#### Computer Engineer is a serious career. We design, manufacture, assembly and deliver serious products. Different operating systems are our machine tools, and compilers are like manufacturing platforms which installed various libraries that act like octopus's tentacles when it compiles our codes. It reaches into our code for analysis, then process components, and according to different production lines, manufacture the products. Afterward, we also need to package and ship the products, delivering them to the corresponding customers based on their specific needs. Later on, if any customers provide after-sales feedback, we must also carry out timely after-sales maintenance.
